# Investment Aggregator

This is a side project to fetch for data in different investment brokers/banks and aggregate them into a single source of data for personal analysis.

## Integrations 
Right now the system is successfully integrated to Rico Provider, being able to log in and fetch for the assests on the broker.

The integration to Nubank is progress and it was heavily inspired on this [repo](https://github.com/lira92/nubank-dotnet).
